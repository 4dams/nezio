## Disclosure

This project has nothing to do with the actual [YAZIO](https://www.yazio.com/en) app.

I have been using their mobile app for more than three years now and have always wanted a web client to track my nutritional intake.

If anyone from [YAZIO](https://www.yazio.com/en) is reading this and you would like me to take this project down, feel free to reach out to me. ü§ôüèª
